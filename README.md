# Laravel and Vite Setup Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a Laravel project with Vite as the frontend build tool.

1. **Create a Laravel Project:**
   ```shell
   composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
   ```
   This command initializes a new Laravel project called `example-app`.

2. **Install Laravel Sail:**
   ```shell
   php artisan sail:install
   ```
   Laravel Sail is a lightweight command-line tool for managing Laravel's Docker environment.

3. **Start Docker Containers:**
   ```shell
   sail up -d
   ```
   This command starts the Docker containers in detached mode, allowing your Laravel application to run within a Docker environment.

4. **Generate an Application Key:**
   ```shell
   sail artisan key:generate --ansi
   ```
   This generates a unique application key for your Laravel app.

5. **Install Laravel UI (for Authentication scaffolding):**
   ```shell
   composer require --dev laravel/ui
   ```
   Laravel UI provides the necessary scaffolding for authentication views and routes.

6. **Install Node.js Packages:**
   ```shell
   sail npm install
   ```
   This installs the required Node.js packages for the project.

7. **Generate Authentication Views (with Bootstrap):**
   ```shell
   sail artisan ui bootstrap --auth
   ```
   This command generates authentication views with Bootstrap styling.

8. **Install Additional Node.js Packages and Build Assets:**
   ```shell
   sail npm install && sail npm run dev
   ```
   Install any additional Node.js packages and build your project's frontend assets.

9. **Create a Symbolic Link to Storage:**
   ```shell
   sail artisan storage:link
   ```
   This creates a symbolic link between the `public` directory and the `storage/app/public` directory for file storage.

10. **Configure Vite (Add to `vite.config.js`):**
    In your `vite.config.js` file, add the following configuration to enable Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for Vite:
    ```javascript
    export default defineConfig({
        server: {
            hmr: {
                host: 'localhost',
            },
        },
        plugins: [
        // ...
        ],
    })
    ```
    This configuration enables HMR for Vite during development.

11. **Run Database Migrations:**
    ```shell
    sail artisan migrate
    ```
    This command runs database migrations, setting up your database schema.

That's it! You've successfully set up a Laravel project with Vite as the frontend build tool. Your project should now be ready for development.
```

Please note that this tutorial provides a high-level overview of the steps involved. Depending on your project's specific requirements, you may need to further customize and configure Laravel, Vite, and other dependencies.
